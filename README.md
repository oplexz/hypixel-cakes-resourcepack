A resourcepack that textures cakes according to their year.

[Download](https://github.com/oplexz/hypixel-cakes-resourcepack/releases/download/v1.0/oplexz-cakes.zip) (Years 0-300)

Update/feature requests: oplexz#8037

### Warning: This resourcepack will reduce your FPS while items are being rendered (e.g. in inventory GUI) and may increase your game startup time while active.

There is no way to optimize this behavior. It will get worse when more textures get added.

## Usage:

These instructions are meant for people who will be editing the code and generating the texture pack manually.

0. Install Node.js
1. `git clone https://github.com/oplexz/hypixel-cakes-resourcepack.git`
2. `cd hypixel-cakes-resourcepack`
3. `npm install`
4. `node index.js`
5. Resourcepack files will be generated in `oplexz-cakes`
